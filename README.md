# TASK DESCRIPTION :
 Sentiment Analysis Using TF-IDF and Logistic Regression
The goal of this task is to perform sentiment analysis on a dataset of customer reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, specifically TF-IDF vectorization and Logistic Regression modeling. Sentiment analysis is a crucial technique in NLP that allows businesses and researchers to understand the emotional tone behind textual data. By identifying whether a review is positive, negative, or neutral, organizations can gain valuable insights into customer satisfaction, preferences, and areas for improvement.

In this project, we will begin by preparing a dataset of customer reviews, where each review has a corresponding sentiment label. The sentiment labels could be categorized into three classes: positive, negative, and neutral. The dataset will be loaded into a Pandas DataFrame for easy manipulation and analysis.

Next, the data will undergo preprocessing to clean the textual content. This includes converting all text to lowercase, removing punctuation and non-alphabetic characters, and eliminating extra spaces. This step is crucial because raw text data often contains noise that can negatively impact the performance of machine learning models.

Once the data is preprocessed, we will apply TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization. TF-IDF is a technique that transforms textual data into numerical vectors by weighing the importance of words in a document relative to a collection of documents. Words that appear frequently in a document but rarely across the entire dataset are given higher weights, helping the model distinguish important terms from common ones.

With the vectorized data ready, we will split the dataset into training and testing sets, ensuring that the model has unseen data to evaluate its performance. The Logistic Regression model, a linear classifier, will be trained on the training set. Logistic Regression is a simple yet powerful algorithm that predicts the probability of a sample belonging to a particular class. In our case, it will predict whether a review is positive, negative, or neutral.

After training the model, we will evaluate its performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and a confusion matrix. These metrics provide insights into how well the model can generalize to unseen data and help identify any potential areas for improvement.

Finally, we will visualize the confusion matrix using Seaborn’s heatmap, which offers a clear visual representation of how many instances were correctly or incorrectly classified for each class. This visualization is essential for understanding the model’s strengths and weaknesses in handling different sentiment categories.

The deliverable for this task is a Jupyter Notebook that documents the entire workflow, from data preprocessing and model building to evaluation and visualization. The notebook should include code cells, explanations, and outputs that demonstrate the logical flow of the analysis.

Through this task, we aim to gain hands-on experience in implementing NLP techniques and machine learning algorithms to solve real-world problems like sentiment analysis. The skills developed here are highly applicable in domains such as e-commerce, customer service, and social media analysis.
